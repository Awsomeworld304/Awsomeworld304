My name is James* and I am a programmer.\
I work in a lot of things but here's a list of languages that I am actively working with:
- Java
- Haxe
- C#
- C++
- C
- Python
- GDScript
- Lua
<!-- md moment -->
I like big robots and I so happen to be working on them.\
You can find the code for that at the [PARTs GitHub](https://github.com/3492PARTs).\
\
I'm also working on little projects in the background.\
\
I'm more backend then fronend in terms of web development, but I'm working on becoming a full-stack developer.\
I love networking, it's so fun.\
\
Programming is like a set of puzzles that you shape, create, and put together.\
It might look scary, but it's not!\
Look through GitHubs [Learn To Code](https://github.com/collections/learn-to-code) collection!\
\
If you wish to contact me, you can do so by reaching out to me on Discord at:\
```jamesprototech```\
\
I'm good at programming, but I'm bad with art.\
Although I've been working on music in FL Studio 21.\

*James is an alias and not my real name.
